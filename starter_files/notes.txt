**To compile a C file**
gcc -o hello hello.c 
    This means compile hello.c and output an executable called hello 

to run this executable run ./hello in the command prompt or F5 in VS Code with the debugger

C has many different named versions that describe which dialect of the langauge youre using
(Generally is the year of the specification)
You can force gcc to use one of these standards with the -std= command line argument. If you want it to be icky abt the standard add "-pedantic"
EX: 
gcc -std=c11 -pedantic foo.c
